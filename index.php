	    	<p>
	    		My education includes a bachelors in Industrial Engineering, but currently I work as a Global IT Quality Manager for a large global company.
	    		My work currently is focused on identifying and gathering details about the top quality issues facing users within the company, and connecting with the domain experts to get the issues resolved quickly.
	    		I use various techniques to measure the satisfaction of our internal users, and utilize my background in technology to understand what the reported issues are referring to and identify who to get in contact with.

		  <div class="panel-body">
	    	<p>
	    		I'm taking this course to deepen my understanding of how web applications work on the back end.
	    		Most of the interfacing that users do with the internet do these days is through web applications such as Facebook, YouTube, etc, and I'm intrigued by how they work under the hood.
	    		Additionally, since PHP is such a commonly deployed technology that many of the modern websites rely upon, I was interested to learn more about it.

		  <div class="panel-body">
	    	<p>
    			Having studied engineering, my background in programming is not as extensive as someone who might have studied computer science or something more directly related with programming
    			However, I have been learning small bits of programming since I was a child, and in the past few years I have really advanced in my coding abilities.
    			The most quickly I have ever improved my programming skills was when I took CS50 several semesters ago. The course covered typical computer science principles in C, then branched into things like HTML, PHP, SQL, and more.
    			That class prepared me for the Java for Distributed Programming class, and several of the more programming intensive classes I have taken since then.
	    	</p>
    		<p>
    			My strongest programming skills are probably in Javascript, but I find that once I dig into a language and start using it more frequently then that language becomes my language of choice.
    			It is quite easy to forget the syntax and some of the implementation details associated with a programming language if you don't use it consistantly, which is why I like continually taking programming  classes - as to not lose my abilities.

		  <div class="panel-heading"><h3>Platforms I am using</h3></div>
		  <div class="panel-body">
	    	<p>
	    		In my daily computing for personal use I use a Ubuntu 14.04 partition on my laptop, which I very much enjoy and prefer over Windows for a variety of reasons. I like being able to hit my favorite keyboard combo (Ctrl-Alt-T) to summon a terminal window at a moments notice.
    			Using the command line gives the feeling to the user that they are more connected to the machine, as it strips away the GUI interface and relies on the raw abilities of the user. It's also just fun, especially with this super clicky mechanical keyboard!
    			For the assignments in this class I will be using my Windows 10 partition (which does not function entirely correctly quite yet), CMDR, SublimeText3, and perhaps PHPStorm as I found I really liked using Webstorm for one of my Javascript intensive classes and it's quite similar.
