#Project 1

The purpose of Project 1 is to set up the GitHub repositories, Digital Ocean Droplet, and deploy a basic web page that will serve as a main page for the other projects in this course.

This proved to be a great refresher for HTML and CSS, as well as how to utilize Git as well as setup hostnames. I did have some trouble getting my domain name to direct to the main page, as it would still display the default Ubuntu Configuration document when going to www.benorman.com.
